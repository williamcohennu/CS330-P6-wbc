          <p id = "bio-text">My name is Will Cohen and I am a senior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science in the McCormick School of Engineering. <br><br> During my time at Northwestern, I have gotten work experience in both software enginnering and finance. <br><br> The summer after my freshman year I interned at Utility, a mobile app design and development agency. At Utility I helped develop and test mobile applications for a wide variety of early-stage funded businesses, corporations, and government clients. I spent most of my time on two projects: Counslr, a healthcare services startup focused on behavioral health for college students, and AsthMe, a healthcare app created for patients with Asthma. <br><br> I spent my sophomore summer at Sagewind Capital, a middle-market private equity firm based in New York City that is primarily focused on the government services industry. <br><br> This past summer I worked at Blackstone, and I will be returning to the Liquid Credit Group after graduation. </p>
