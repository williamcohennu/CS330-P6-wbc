            <p class = "crowdstrike-section-header">Company Background</p>
            <p class = "crowdstrike-section-content">Crowdstrike was founded in 2011 and is based in Sunnyvalle, California. The firm provides endpoint security, threat intelligence, and cyber attack response services to companies through their Falcon Platform, which is a single integrated cloud-based solution. The company is currently in a groweth phrase: CrowdStrike doubled its market share in the Endpoint Security market between 2018-2019 while the top three vendors saw a decline in their market share. <br><br> Falcon is CrowdStrike’s core security offering. Falcon is a lightweight application that is installed to an endpoint; Falcon’s services are deployed via the cloud. Falcon is getting smarter; the cloud allows data to constantly be sent back and forth to improve the algorithms that detect and prevent breaches, and core functions also work if the endpoint is offline or not connected to the internet.</p>
            <p class = "crowdstrike-section-header">Business Model</p>
            <p class = "crowdstrike-section-content">CrowdStrike is yet to be profitable. Their largest expense each quarter is on Sales and Marketing as they continue to grow and spend money reaching new customers. CrowdStrike also is spending a lot on Research and Development as they build new modules and diversify their product offering. <br><br> We believe that these sales and marketing expenses will eventually decrease once CrowdStrike becomes more popular and they lock up their largest customers. This will be CrowdStrike’s path to profitability. <br><br>To summarize, CrowdStrike is currently in hyper growth mode and their sales and marketing expenses have been in excess of total revenue in recent years. They are cash flow positive, and as soon as they decide that they have acquired enough customers their path to profitability will be quick and easy. Also, with a net dollar based retention rate above 100%, they will be able to grow revenue even without new customer acquisition.</p>
            <p class = "crowdstrike-section-header">Risks</p>
            <p class = "crowdstrike-section-content">One large breach of CrowdStrike’s systems could be devastating for the company. If customers are not able to fully trust the security capabilities that CrowdStrike offers then they will find alternative options. <br><br> The cyber security industry, being comprised of mostly software solutions, has a relatively low barrier to entry. A new startup with a completely different approach to cyber security could quickly gain market share in the industry if their solutions are deemed superior. <br><br>CrowdStrike relies on Amazon Web Services to host and operate their Falcon system. If Amazon decides that they want to focus more of their attention on distributing their own cyber security solutions, this could hurt CrowdStrike. Conversely, CrowdStrike could be a good acquisition target if Amazon decides they want to go in this direction.</p>
